After the COVID19 pandemic, e-commerce is quickly becoming a widely accepted and used business model. More and more businesses are developing web sites that allow them to conduct commercial transactions over the internet. It is fair to argue that online purchasing is growing more common. Moreover, due to the large segment that uses electronics nowadays and the emerging demand on electronics in the future, we decided to create an e-commerce website for Electronics Sale.

The objective of this project is to create an e-commerce website for Electronics Sale. It shows the user a catalogue of various products that may be purchased at the store. A shopping cart is supplied to the user to make online purchases easier. The goods in the shopping cart will be displayed as an order at the moment of checkout. More information will be required at that time to complete the transaction. The consumer will typically be prompted to fill out or select a billing address, a shipping address, a shipping option, and payment information, all of which will be saved in the user account. As soon as the order is placed, a customer service representative will contact the user to confirm the order.
The system is implemented using a 3-tier approach, with a backend database using MySQL, and php, a middle tier of PhpmyAdmin for communication between the database and the front end, and a web browser as the front-end client using BOOTSTRAP, HTML5, CSS3 and JS.
